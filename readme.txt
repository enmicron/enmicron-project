;====================================================================================================================;


Eura Antivirus is an local freeware Antivirus specialized to handling solve local viruses or abroad that epidemic in 
Indonesia. by using own engine antivirus, Eura Antivirus can scanning virus flashily and accurate. And adding with 
its' algorithmic heuristic, the various virus (new even thought old various) able on database Eura Antivirus detected

;====================================================================================================================;


Even thought security law and comfortable is inversely proportional, but I tried to modify,  how antivirus which 
I made not only give secure by many difficulties understands by EuraAV user. So at EuraAV Procedures that i made can 
be following by other user.

especial component of EuraAV with the new one. By external database you do not need redownload file many times of 
EuraAV package totally, you just download the database file and supporting file only. This file named by "euradat.zip" 
that it would extract and you put on the place you sets or put EuraAV. After that you do not need to download package 
EuraAV totally and you just download the file database and supporting file. On this new EuraAV I have two update types,
they are "euradat.zip"   and "esuperdat.zip". On this kind of EuraAV "euradat.zip" is update type that focus on change
database and supporting file on EuraAV, this file have more small size from file size an  file  package core  EuraAV, 
so you do not so burdening while redownload EuraAV.  Is while “esuperdat.zip" is update tipe specialized for renew 
engine of   EuraAV it self. This update type should not always does every day, because Update “esuperdat.zip" needed 
while any changing and or renewal happening.
